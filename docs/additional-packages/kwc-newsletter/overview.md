#NEWSLETTER

The newsletter functionality of Koala Framework is implemented using components.  
You can edit your newsletter using paragraphs in the backend, where by default you have the text-image component available.  
Of course you can create custom components so you can build your newsletter with exactly the functionality and design you need.  
<br>

Because the newsletter component uses "Kwc_Mail_Component" to send the mail, [styling the newsletter](kwc-mail-component/styling.md) works exactly the same.  
For a short overview of the newsletter visit the [about page](http://www.koala-framework.org/about/newsletter).  
For a working demo try [kwf-newsletter-demo](http://www.koala-framework.org/about/newsletter/installation).
