#RECIPIENTS

By default the recipients model used is `Kwc_Newsletter_Subscribe_Model` which is meant to be used for a classical newsletter system where users can subscribe.

It is also possible to use other models - like customers from a CRM model, or users from a shop or whatever model you might have.
